# 06. Building a database

## 6.1 Data base design
There are critical questions that should drive your design, when you create your own tables to support your business:

Design questions
- What are the business requirements?
- What tables will I need to fulfill those requirements?
- What columns will each table contain?
- How will the tables be normalized?
- What will their parent/child relationships be?

## 6.2 Populating data
**Populating data** should be part of the planning process too. If the data is not maintainable and kept up to
date, then the design has already failed. This factor is often overlooked and can easily cause a database project to fail. 

Data questions
- How much data will be populated into these tables?
- Who/what will populate the data into these tables?
- Where will the data come from?
- Do we need processes to automatically populate the tables?

## 6.3 Security
For centralized databases, security factors should be considered.
Security questions
- Who should have access to this database?
- Who should have access to which tables? Read-only access? Write access?
- Is this database critical to business operations?
- What backup plans do we have in the event of disaster/failure?
- Should we log the changes to tables?
- If the database is used for websites or web applications, is it secure?

## 6.4 Design a database for the following scenario

Imagine you have an application that registers all existing startup companies, and provide
We need to design a database to manage the :
- attendees:  are registered users (including some VIPs) who are checking out the startup companies. **Each attendee’s 
  ID, name, phone number, email, and VIP status** will need to be tracked.
  
- companies: are the companies. The **company ID, company name, company description, and primary contact** (who should be listed as an attendee) for
each must be tracked
  
- presentations: Some companies will schedule to do a presentation for a specific slot of time (with a start time and end time). 
  The company leading the presentation as well as a room number must also be booked for each presentation slot
  
- rooms: There will be rooms available for the presentations, each with a **room ID number, a floor number, and a seating capacity**
  
- presentation_attendance: If attendees are interested in hearing a company’s presentation, they can acquire a
ticket (with a ticket ID) and be allowed in. To implement this, the PRESENTATION_ATTENDANCE table will track
the **ticket IDs and pair the presentations with the attendees through their respective IDs** to show who was where
  
### 6.4.1 Primary and foreign keys

**A primary key is a special field (or combination of fields) that provides a unique identity to each record**

Do not confuse the primary key with a foreign key. **The primary key exists in the parent table, but the foreign key 
exists in the child table**. The foreign key in a child table points to the primary key in its parent table. 

For example, the ATTENDEE_ID in the ATTENDEE table is a primary key, but the ATTENDEE_ID in the PRESENTATION_ATTENDANCE 
table is a foreign key.

### 6.4.2 Schema
Applying our knowledge of primary keys and foreign keys, we can establish the relationships between these five 
tables and draw a database schema as shown in below figure.

![database_schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pengfei99/LearningSQL/main/Oreilly_getting_started_with_sql/img/schema.PNG)

All the primary keys and foreign keys are connected by arrows. The non-tipped side of the arrow ties to a primary key, 
while the tipped side points to a foreign key. These arrows visualize how each parent table supplies data to a child table.

### 6.4.3 Create database

In sqllite, you can use the tool gui to add one database. 

In mysql

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <databasename>;

CREATE DATABASE surgetech_conference;
```

### 6.4.4 Create table

Note when we create table, we need column name, type. Optionally, we can add 
- **not null**: to indicate this column can not have null value,
- **primary key**: to indicate this column is the primary key.
- **DEFAULT(value)**: give a default value of the column
- **FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES <TABLE_NAME>(COLUMN_NAME)**: define a column as foreign key and provide the linked primary key
table and column name.
  
- **CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_name) ATTENDEE(primary_key_name)**: Create a foreign key constrain,
  Note the naming convention of the constraint is FK followed by parent table name then child table name. 
  For example: FK_ATTENDEE_COMPANY

#### The foreign key constrain

The foreign key constrain can prevent invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column. For instance, if we
insert a row into the PRESENTATION table with a BOOKED_COMPANY_ID that we can't find in COMPANY(COMPANY_ID). The insert
will fail.



```sql
CREATE TABLE ATTENDEE (
ATTENDEE_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
FIRST_NAME VARCHAR (30) NOT NULL,
LAST_NAME VARCHAR (30) NOT NULL,
PHONE INTEGER,
EMAIL VARCHAR (30),
VIP BOOLEAN DEFAULT (0)
);

CREATE TABLE COMPANY (
COMPANY_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
NAME VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(60),
PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID INTEGER NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES ATTENDEE(ATTENDEE_ID),
CONSTRAINT FK_ATTENDEE_COMPANY FOREIGN KEY (PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID) ATTENDEE(ATTENDEE_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE PRESENTATION (
PRESENTATION_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
BOOKED_COMPANY_ID INTEGER NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES COMPANY(COMPANY_ID),
BOOKED_ROOM_ID INTEGER NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES ROOM(ROOM_ID),
START_TIME TIME,
END_TIME TIME
);

CREATE TABLE PRESENTATION_ATTENDANCE (
TICKET_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
PRESENTATION_ID INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES PRESENTATION(PRESENTATION_ID),
ATTENDEE_ID INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES ATTENDEE(ATTENDEE_ID)
);


CREATE TABLE ROOM (
ROOM_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
FLOOR_NUMBER INTEGER NOT NULL,
SEAT_CAPACITY INTEGER NOT NULL
);

```

If the table is already created without foreign key, we can alter the table to add foreign key. For example, if 
PRESENTATION_ATTENDANCE table does not declare the foreign key,

```sql
ALTER TABLE PRESENTATION_ATTENDANCE
ADD FOREIGN KEY (PRESENTATION_ID) REFERENCES PRESENTATION(PRESENTATION_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ATTENDEE_ID) REFERENCES ATTENDEE(ATTENDEE_ID);
```

To add a constraint to a table

```sql
ALTER TABLE COMPANY
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_ATTENDEE_COMPANY FOREIGN KEY (PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID) ATTENDEE(ATTENDEE_ID)
```

You can also drop the foreign key constrain

```sql
ALTER TABLE COMPANY
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_ATTENDEE_COMPANY;
```

### 6.4.5 Creating views

**A table contains data, a view is just a SELECT statement which has been saved in the database (more or less, depending on your database)**.

The advantage of a view is that it can join data from several tables(denormalize tables) without duplicating data. 
For instance, suppose you have a database with many tables, you need to do some complex statistical queries and join to 
calculate the highest salary of each department. **Instead of sending the complex query to the database all the time, 
you can save the query as a view and then SELECT * FROM view**

**As the data is completely derived from a SELECT query, so you cannot modify the data via a view.**

Suppose we want a more descriptive view of the PRESENTATION table, which pulls in the booked company and booked room 
information.

```sql
SELECT
COMPANY.NAME as BOOKED_COMPANY,
ROOM.ROOM_ID as ROOM_NUMBER,
ROOM.FLOOR_NUMBER as FLOOR,
ROOM.SEAT_CAPACITY as SEATS,
START_TIME,
END_TIME
FROM PRESENTATION
INNER JOIN COMPANY
ON PRESENTATION.BOOKED_COMPANY_ID = COMPANY.COMPANY_ID
INNER JOIN ROOM
ON PRESENTATION.BOOKED_ROOM_ID = ROOM.ROOM_ID
```

We can use below command to create a view based on the above select

```sql
CREATE VIEW DETAILED_PRESENTATION_VW
    AS SELECT COMPANY.NAME as BOOKED_COMPANY,
       ROOM.ROOM_ID as ROOM_NUMBER,
       ROOM.FLOOR_NUMBER as FLOOR,
       ROOM.SEAT_CAPACITY as SEATS,
       START_TIME,
       END_TIME
       FROM PRESENTATION
       INNER JOIN COMPANY
       ON PRESENTATION.BOOKED_COMPANY_ID = COMPANY.COMPANY_ID
       INNER JOIN ROOM
       ON PRESENTATION.BOOKED_ROOM_ID = ROOM.ROOM_ID;
```

After the view creation, you can query the view with select as a table. Below is an example.

```sql
select * from DETAILED_PRESENTATION_VW where seats >10;
```

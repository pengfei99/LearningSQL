# 05 Join tables togethor

Before we talk about join, we need to understand the relationships between tables. There are three types of relations:
- one to one : A record in one table is related to one record in another table.
- one-to-many: A record in one table is related to many records in another table.
- many-to-many: Multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table.

**Handling a one-to-one relationship or a one-or-many relationship can be done by adding the primary key of one table into the other table as a foreign key.** To bring the two table togethor, we need to use the join on **primary key and foreign key**.

Let's use the **rexon_metals.db** database. It contains the **CUSTOMER** and **CUSTOMER_ORDER** tables and you can notice it is a one-to-many relationship. Because one customer can have many customer orders.

There are seven common join types, you can check them in the below figure. We will discuss them one by one

You may ask why we separate data into tables and merge them back?

- Because through normalization, we can store data efficiently, no duplicates means less error and easy to maintain. 
- Merge tables together on common fields to create more descriptive views of the data for easy data analysis.

## 5.1 Inner join

**The INNER JOIN allows us to merge two tables together**. But if we are going to merge tables, we need to define a commonality between the two so records from both tables line up. We need to **define one or more fields they have in common and join on them**.

In general, in a one to many relation, **the common columns are the primary key of the one, and the foreign key of the many**. In the case of the customer and customer_order example, the common column is the **customer_id**  


Imagine that we want to ship the order to the customer home address. But you can notice there is no address info in the customer_order table. So we need to join the customer table with customer_order table to get the address. Below query is an example of the inner join 

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
ORDER_DATE,
SHIP_DATE,
NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
PRODUCT_ID,
ORDER_QTY
from customer inner join customer_order 
on customer.customer_id=customer_order.customer_id
```

The first thing you can noticed is that for the column **customer_id** we need to use an explicit syntax **customer.customer_id** or **customer_order.customer_id**. Because this column exists in both table. For other columns, we don't need this.

The **FROM statement is where we execute our INNER JOIN**. We specify that we are pulling from CUSTOMER and inner joining it with CUSTOMER_ORDER , and that the commonality is on the CUSTOMER_ID fields 

### 5.1.1 Inner join speciality.

You can notice the output of the above query only has three distinct customer. But in the customer table, we have five distinct customer. Why we are losing two of them?

Because **with INNER JOIN , any records that do not have a common joined value in both tables will be excluded**. As the two customer do not have any order, so they are exluded from the merged table. 

If we want to include all records from the CUSTOMER table, we can accomplish this with a LEFT JOIN

## 5.2 Left (outer) join

In some case, we may want to join tables and see all customers, even if they had no orders. We can accomplish this with a LEFT JOIN.

### 5.2.1 left(outer) inclusive join

By default the left(outer) join is inclusive, which means all member of the left table is included in the result table.

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
ORDER_DATE,
SHIP_DATE,
NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
PRODUCT_ID,
ORDER_QTY
from customer left join customer_order 
on customer.customer_id=customer_order.customer_id
```

With the above query, you can see all the customer in the merge table, but all the fields(columns) that come from CUSTOMER_ORDER are null, because there were no orders to join to. 

### 5.2.2 left(outer) exclusive join
 
It is also common to use LEFT JOIN to check for “orphaned” child records that have no parent, or conversely a parent that has no children (e.g., orders that have no customers, or customers that have no orders).

Below query shows all customers that has zero order, by adding **order_id is null**

```sql
SELECT
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME
FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID
WHERE ORDER_ID IS NULL
```

## 5.3 right join

Right join is similar to the left join. If you inverse the table order in the left join, a left join can simulate the behavior of the right join.

However, the RIGHT JOIN is rarely used and should be avoided. You should stick to convention and prefer left outer joins with LEFT JOIN , and put
the “all records” table on the left side of the join operator.

## 5.4 full outer join

There also is a **full outer join** operator called OUTER JOIN that includes all records from both tables. It does a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN simultaneously, and can have null records in both tables. It can be helpful to find orphaned records in both directions simultaneously in a single query, but it also is seldom used.

## 5.5 Joining Multiple Tables

Tables can have relationhips with more than one table. For instance, A given table can be the child of more than one parent table, and a table can be the parent to one table but a child to another. 

Let's check our database, we have observed the relationship between **CUSTOMER and CUSTOMER_ORDER** . But there is another table we can include that will make our orders more meaningful: the **PRODUCT table**. Notice that the CUSTOMER_ORDER table has a PRODUCT_ID column, which corresponds to a product in the PRODUCT table.

Below query join the three tables togethor. Note after the from operator, we have two inner join operator, the order can be changed, and the result is the same.

```sql
SELECT
ORDER_ID,
c.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
ORDER_DATE,
PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
ORDER_QTY
FROM CUSTOMER as c
inner join customer_order as o on c.CUSTOMER_ID=o.CUSTOMER_ID
inner join product as p on o.product_id=p.product_id 
```

We’ve merged these three tables, we can use fields from all three tables to create expressions. If we want to find the revenue for each order, we can multiply ORDER_QTY and PRICE, even though those fields exist in two separate tables.

```sql
SELECT
ORDER_ID,
c.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
ORDER_DATE,
PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
ORDER_QTY,
order_qty*price as order_revenue
FROM CUSTOMER as c
inner join customer_order as o on c.CUSTOMER_ID=o.CUSTOMER_ID
inner join product as p on o.product_id=p.product_id 

```

## 5.6 Grouping joins

In the above section, we have used join to calculate the revenu for each order. Now suppose we want to find the total revenue by customer. With previous experience, we know we need two steps:
1. join the three table and calculate the revenue for each order
2. group by the customer and sum the all revenue belong to user.

```sql
select c.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
sum(order_qty*price) as total_revenue
from customer as c
inner join customer_order as o on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
inner join product as p on o.product_id=p.product_id
group by c.customer_id, customer_name
```

Now we want to see revenue of all customer, even though they has zero order.

```sql
select c.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
sum(order_qty*price) as total_revenue
from customer as c
left join customer_order as o on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
left join product as p on o.product_id=p.product_id
group by c.customer_id, customer_name
```

Note we replace all two inner join by left join. Because one left join can keep all the customer, but seconde inner join will exclude the customer with zero order even though the inner join does not happen directly on customer and product table. This is because null values produced by the first left join cannot be inner joined with product. **All null values will always get filtered out in a inner join. A LEFT JOIN tolerates null values.**

### 5.6.1 Replace null 
we may want the values to default to 0 instead of null if there are no sales. We can accomplish this simply with the coalesce() function we learned before

```sql
select c.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
coalesce(sum(order_qty*price),0) as total_revenue
from customer as c
left join customer_order as o on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
left join product as p on o.product_id=p.product_id
group by c.customer_id, customer_name
```

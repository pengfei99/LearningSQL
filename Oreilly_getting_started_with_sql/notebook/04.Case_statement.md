# 04. Case statement

A **CASE statement** allows us to map one or more conditions to a corresponding value for each condition. You start a CASE statement with the word CASE and conclude it with an END . Between those keywords, you specify each condition with a WHEN [condition] THEN [value] , where the [condition] and the corresponding [value] are supplied by you. After specifying the condition–value pairs, you can have a catch-all value to default to if none of the conditions were met, which is specified in the ELSE.

Below query is an example on how we categorize wind_speed into wind_severity categories, where any speed greater than 40 is 'HIGH' , 30 to 40 is 'MODERATE' , and
anything less is 'LOW' 

```sql
select report_code, year, month, day, wind_speed, 
case 
    when wind_speed > 40 then "HIGH"
    when wind_speed >=30 and wind_speed <=40 then "MODERATE" 
    else "LOW"
end as wind_severity
from station_data 
```

## 4.1 Case statement order matters

We can actually omit the AND wind_speed <=40 condition in the second when clause. Becaue **the sql parser processes a CASE statement from top to bottom, and the first condition it finds true is the one it uses (and it will stop evaluating subsequent conditions)**. So if we have a record with a wind_speed of 43, we can be certain it will be evaluated as 'HIGH'. Although it is greater than 30, it will not be assigned 'MODERATE' because it will not get to that point. 

As a result below query will output the same result as the above one
```sql
select report_code, year, month, day, wind_speed, 
case 
    when wind_speed > 40 then "HIGH"
    when wind_speed >=30 then "MODERATE" 
    else "LOW"
end as wind_severity
from station_data 
```

## 4.2 Group by the output of case operator

The output of case can be used in the group by operator, because they are not aggregated results. Below query shows an example on group by **wind_severity**

Although we can access the value of the case statement, the alias "wind_severity" can not be used as reference in the group by. **We can only use the index of the case operator position. Note the index of the position starts by 1**.
```sql
-- bad query
select report_code, year, month, day, wind_speed,
case
    when wind_speed > 40 then "HIGH"
    when wind_speed >=30 then "MODERATE"
    else "LOW"
end as wind_severtiy
from station_data
group by year, wind_severity

-- correct query
select report_code, year, month, day, wind_speed,
case
    when wind_speed > 40 then "HIGH"
    when wind_speed >=30 then "MODERATE"
    else "LOW"
end as wind_severtiy
from station_data
group by year, 6

```

## 4.3 Use column value in then

In above example, in the then value, we always used a given value. We can also use other column value here. Below we use tornado as condition, and precipitation as value.

```sql
select year, month
case 
    when tornado=1 then precipitation ELSE 0 
END as tornado_precipitation,
case 
    when tornado=0 then precipitation else 0
end as no_tornado_precipitation
from station_data

```

## 4.4 The “Zero/Null” CASE Trick

The “zero/null” CASE trick allows you to apply different “filters” for different aggregate values, all in a single SELECT query. For instance, if you want to aggregate precipitation into two sums, tornado_precipitation and non_tornado_precipitation, and GROUP BY year and month.

If you want to use where operator, you have to use two select then use a inner join.

```sql
select  year, month, 
sum(precipitation) as tornado_precipitation
from station_data
where tornado=1
group by year, month;

select  year, month, 
sum(precipitation) as non_tornado_precipitation
from station_data
where tornado=0
group by year, month;
```

With the case operator, we can do it in a single select

```sql
select year, month,
sum(case when tornado=1 then precipitation else 0 end ) as tornado_precipitation,
sum(case when tornado=0 then precipitation else 1 end ) as non_tornado_precipitation
from station_data
group by year, month;
```
This case trick applies to all aggregation operators, below are examples to find the minimum, or maximum precipitation when tornadoes were present and when they were not

```sql
select year, month,
min(case when tornado=1 then precipitation else 0 end ) as min_tornado_precipitation,
min(case when tornado=0 then precipitation else 1 end ) as min_non_tornado_precipitation
from station_data
group by year, month;


select year, month,
max(case when tornado=1 then precipitation else 0 end ) as max_tornado_precipitation,
max(case when tornado=0 then precipitation else 1 end ) as max_non_tornado_precipitation
from station_data
group by year, month;
```

## 4.5 Multiple boolean condition in the case operator

You can use any **Boolean expressions(single/multiple) in a CASE statement, including functions and AND , OR , and NOT statements**. The following query
will find the average temperatures by month when rain/hail was present versus not present after the year 2000

```sql
select month,
avg(case when rain or hail then temperatures else null end) as precipitation_temperature,
avg(case when not (rain or hail) then temperatures else null end) as non_precipitation_temperature
from station_data
where year>=2000
group by month;

```

Note, in the above query we use null instead of 0 for temperatur default value if condition is not satisfait. Because 0 in temperature has a meaning
